E-Mail Registration\r\n\r\nDeadline extended to March 20th\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\nCub Scouts, Boy and Girl Scouts of all ages and skills are invited to participate!  The orienteering courses consist of a series of flags (“control points”) set up in a linear course around the trails of Champoeg State Park. Scouts attending the Scout-O will be grouped according to rank and will navigate courses matched to their skill level.  Scouts will participate in pairs or in small groups, while older, more experienced Scouts may complete solo if they choose.\r\n\r\nStart Procedure:  \r\n\r\nThe participants will be started on the courses in staggered intervals, (every 2 minutes), very similar to the way tee times are assigned at a golf course.  The start times are assigned through the pre-registration procedure.  \r\n\r\nA list of the start assignments is posted in the results section of the main CROC web page(updated frequently).  Start times for courses 1 and 2 fill up quickly, so register early.  Once all the time slots are filled up, the event will be closed.\r\n\r\nCourse Description:\r\n\r\nThe Scout-O will offer four orienteering courses, with the intention that Scouts will compete with other Scouts of the same rank.  Therefore, please read the following course descriptions carefully and be sure your Scouts are registered for appropriate courses.\r\n\r\nGeneral Notes:  Course 1 is noncompetitive and for learning the basics only.\r\nMixed rank category teams are allowed, but must compete on the course of the higher-ranking Scout.  Also, each troop may have one 3 person team to allow for an odd number of participants.  All other teams must be in pairs of two.\r\n\r\nCourse 1 \r\n\r\nCourse 1 is a non-competitive course designed to introduce Cub Scouts, Webelos and Brownies to orienteering.  These Scouts will participate in small groups of two to four Scouts.  Each group of no more than four Scouts must be accompanied by an adult, who should follow his/her group, not lead it.  \r\n\r\nCourse 2 \r\n\r\nCourse 2 is for pairs of Tenderfoot, Second Class and First Class Boy Scouts, and Girl Scout Juniors.   It is recommended that an adult trail the pair, but NOT communicate with the Scouts except in the case of an emergency.\r\n\r\nCourse 3 \r\n\r\nCourse 3 is for pairs of Star, Life and Eagle Boy Scouts, and Girl Scout Cadettes and Seniors. No adults are allowed to accompany teams on this course.\r\n\r\nCourse 4  \r\n\r\nCourse 4 is for individual entrants only-no pairs.  It is limited to Scouts (including Explorers and Adult Scouters) with a fair amount of orienteering experience.\r\nRemember, only Courses 2 and 3 count toward the team and troop competitive award scoring.  Course 4 counts for the individual award competition.  \r\n\r\nHow Long will it take?\r\n\r\nThat really depends on the kids.  Some race through their courses in less than 1 hour, others take their time and stay out 2 to 2(1/2) hours. This is true of all the courses.  \r\n\r\nCompasses:  \r\n\r\nA limited number of compasses will be available for rent ($1).  If the kids have compasses, they should bring them.  \r\n\r\nClothing:\r\n\r\nIt is a good idea to have each kid bring something dry and warm to change into at the end of the event.  April days can be cold and wet. Synthetic clothing is better than cotton.\r\n\r\nCost:\r\n$7.50 per entry (an entry is one group, team, or individual)\r\n\r\nTraining Opportunities: \r\n \r\nThere will be a limited number of 30-minute training sessions offered to acquaint Scouts with the basic terms and techniques of orienteering.  Be sure to indicate on the pre-registration form how many of your Scouts will be attending a training session. Pre-registration for the training sessions is REQUIRED.\r\n\r\nPre-registration:  \r\n\r\nAll Scout-O participants must be pre-registered by March 13, 2004.  This year you can do it either by e-mail or regular mail.\r\n\r\nE-mail registration:  \r\n\r\n1.)	Decide how teams of scouts you plan on having and which courses they will compete on.\r\n2.)

The orienteering courses consist of a series of flags (“control points”) set up in a linear course around the trails of Cook Park. Scouts attending the Scout-O will be grouped according to rank and will navigate courses matched to their skill level.  Scouts will participate in pairs or in small groups, while older, more experienced Scouts may complete solo if they choose.\r\n\r\nStart Procedure:  \r\n\r\nThe participants will be started on the courses in staggered intervals, (every 2 minutes), very similar to the way tee times are assigned at a golf course.  The start times are assigned through the pre-registration procedure.  \r\n\r\nA list of the start assignments is posted on this web page (updated frequently).  Start times for courses 1 and 2 fill up quickly, so register early.  Once all the time slots are filled up, the event will be closed.\r\n\r\nNote:  Early start times are over rated.   The course will be up all day (til 2 or 3 PM) and most kids will finish in several hours.   I encourage people to come for the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourse Description:\r\n\r\nThe Scout-O will offer four orienteering courses, with the intention that Scouts will compete with other Scouts of the same rank.  Therefore, please read the following course descriptions carefully and be sure your Scouts are registered for appropriate courses.\r\n\r\nGeneral Notes:  Course 1 is noncompetitive and for learning the basics only.\r\nMixed rank category teams are allowed, but must compete on the course of the higher-ranking Scout.  Also, each troop may have one 3-person team to allow for an odd number of participants.  All other teams must be in pairs of two.\r\n\r\nCourse 1 \r\n\r\nCourse 1 is a non-competitive course designed to introduce Cub Scouts, Webelos and Brownies to orienteering.  These Scouts will participate in small groups of two to four Scouts.  Each group of no more than four Scouts must be accompanied by an adult, who should follow his/her group, not lead it.  \r\n\r\nCourse 2 \r\n\r\nCourse 2 is for pairs of Tenderfoot, Second Class and First Class Boy Scouts, and Girl Scout Juniors.   It is recommended that an adult trail the pair, but NOT communicate with the Scouts except in the case of an emergency.\r\n\r\nCourse 3 \r\n\r\nCourse 3 is for pairs of Star, Life and Eagle Boy Scouts, and Girl Scout Cadettes and Seniors. No adults are allowed to accompany teams on this course.\r\n\r\nCourse 4  \r\n\r\nCourse 4 is for individual entrants only-no pairs.  It is limited to Scouts (including Explorers and Adult Scouters) with a fair amount of orienteering experience.\r\nRemember, only Courses 2 and 3 count toward the team and troop competitive award scoring.  Course 4 counts for the individual award competition.  \r\n\r\nHow Long will it take?\r\n\r\nThat really depends on the kids.  Some race through their courses in less than 1 hour, others take their time and stay out 1 to 2 hours. This is true of all the courses.  \r\n\r\nCost:\r\n$7.50 per entry (an entry is one group, team, or individual)\r\n\r\nTraining Opportunities: \r\n \r\nThere will be a limited number of 30-minute training sessions offered to acquaint Scouts with the basic terms and techniques of orienteering.  Be sure to indicate on the pre-registration form how many of your Scouts will be attending a training session. Pre-registration for the training sessions is REQUIRED.\r\n\r\nPre-registration:  \r\n\r\nAll Scout-O participants must be pre-registered by April 1, 2005.  This year you can do it either by e-mail or regular mail.\r\n\r\nE-mail registration:  \r\n\r\n1.)	Decide how many teams of scouts you plan on having and which courses they will compete on.\r\n2.)

Nevertheless, the advanced course will be designed with route choice challenges in mind, and will be a little longer than typical due to the flat terrain.\r\n\r\nCOURSES  The standard four different courses will be available, plus an additional “Grey” course: \r\nWhite	= introduction (about 1 mile),  \r\nYellow	= beginner (about 1.5 mile) \r\nOrange	= Intermediate (about 3.5 miles)\r\nGreen	= advanced (about 4.5 miles)\r\n"Grey"	= longer version of the White/Yellow courses (5 miles)\r\n\r\nThe "Grey" course is suitable for the Boy Scout Second Class requirement "Using a compass and a map together, take a five-mile hike (or 10 miles by bike) approved by your adult leader and your parent or guardian."  \r\nThe "Grey" course  is also appropriate for recreational “Map Hikers” who want a good walk lasting two to three hours \r\nThe grey course will be on established trails, and the route will include woods, fields, ponds and the Willamette River bank, with abundant wildlife in the morning, including falcons and hawks, beaver, muskrats, coyotes and weasels .\r\n\r\nThe Orange course is very appropriate as satisfaction of the Boy Scout First Class requirement \r\n"Using a compass, complete an orienteering course that covers at least one mile and requires measuring the height and/or width of designated items (tree, tower, canyon, ditch, etc.)" \r\nThe "measure height/width of an object" are NOT part of the sport of orienteering, but I will have a separate station with instruction and a test for that BSA requirement.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\nThe team time is posted on the CROC web site a couple of days after the event.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION and COST\r\nThe event is open to the public.

Hood. \r\n\r\nTo maximize these features â€” and give you more time to enjoy them â€” we have expanded our new map and designed a challenging long-distance event for intermediate and advanced orienteers. The <b>â€œGoatâ€</b> course is 10 km, traversing steep rocky terrain with a lot (400 m) of climbing. A shorter version of this course (a 6.6 km <b>Kid</b> with 300 m of climb) will be available. <i>E-punch will be used on these two courses only.</i>\r\n\r\nA beginner course of about 1.5 km will be entirely on trails but wonâ€™t stint on the above-mentioned scenery.\r\n\r\n<b>Start times:</b> Registration is at 10 a.m. The Goat and Kid courses will have a mass start at 11 a.m. There is a four hour time limit.\r\n\r\nBeginner course start times are from 11:15 a.m. to 1 p.m.; the course closes at 3 p.m.\r\n\r\n<b>Updated Course Setter''s Notes (as of 9-3-08):</b> The Columbia Goat at Catherine Creek will be a real Goat, not like those three other Goats that CROC has had. Those were flat and fast. Wimpy. Okay, ORCA''s Dutchman Goat was a real Goat. This year''s Goat will be a long, steep, and rocky challenge. And  probably hot, too. There will be different maps for the Goat and Kid, so you have to select your course before you start. Both courses will take you to new areas of the map.\r\n\r\n<b>Course lengths:</b>\r\nGoat 8.6 km, 400 m climb\r\nKid 6.3 km, 300 m climb\r\nNavigation will be a mix of intermediate and advanced.\r\n\r\nCliffs â€“ don''t go blindly following the connection lines and run off a cliff. I suggest you look for trails.\r\n\r\nPoison oak â€“ plenty of it, of various colors. But the course setter hates the stuff, and planned controls accordingly. Poison oak is mostly mapped as green lines on the map. There will be good route choices around the big areas. You may have to step around little patches. And for your comfort and enjoyment, there will two marked routes (using flagging tape) to guide you though some unavoidable P.O.\r\n\r\nOther plants â€“ Seeds and stickers have been a problem. You might want gaiters.\r\n\r\nWater â€“ did I mention it will be hot? And you will be climbing, descending, climbing, descending, climbing ... (you get the idea). There will be two water stations, both at trail intersections marked on the map, not at controls. The first will be at about 1/4 of the way. The second at about 1/2, and again at 3/4 of the way. You might have to go slightly off a straight line, but my advice is: drink.\r\n\r\nWildlife â€“ perhaps some deer. I have not noticed any ticks this year.\r\n\r\nRest rooms â€“ none, nada, nil, zip, zilch. Plan accordingly.

The "vampires" leave 3 minutes after everyone else has begun. They carry a "vampire" card, worth zero points. When they come within five meters of another orienteer and yell "vampire attack!", the "victim" must surrender his or her punch card (along with all of its points) to the vampire, who then receives the Vampire card. The victim then becomes the vampire (but cannot immediately re-tag the original vampire, of course). [Note: this is often done at night with flashlights, so we''re adjusting the rules here for the daytime...!] If you come, plan on being "attacked" by a few vampires - just don''t get stuck with a "vampire" card at the end of the hour-long event...\r\n\r\nExpect the theatrics of last year''s event, with yet a few new twists this time around...!

We will contact all pre-registered groups with the confirmed new location as soon as possible.</b>\r\n\r\nCub Scouts, Boy and Girl Scouts of all ages and skills are invited to participate!  Come and enjoy a day of fun and friendly competition at <b> Cook Park in Tigard</b>!  This event gives scouts a chance to improve their skills and navigate the beautiful trails of <b>Cook Park</b>.  The orienteering courses consist of a series of flags ("control points") set up in a linear course around the trails of <b>Cook Park</b>. Workshops will be provided to help Scouts interested in passing off requirements for the BSA Orienteering merit badge or GSA Orienteering interest project. Scouts attending the Scout-O will be grouped according to rank and will navigate courses matched to their skill level. Scouts will participate in pairs or in small groups.\r\n\r\nThe Scout-O will offer four orienteering courses, with the intention that Scouts will compete with other Scouts of the same rank. Therefore, please read the following course descriptions carefully and be sure your Scouts are registered for appropriate courses.\r\n\r\nGeneral Notes: Course 1 is noncompetitive and for learning the basics only.\r\nMixed rank category teams are allowed, but must compete on the course of the higher-ranking Scout. Also, each troop may have one 3-person team to allow for an odd number of participants. All other teams must be in pairs of two.\r\n\r\nCourse 1 \r\n\r\nCourse 1 is a non-competitive course designed to introduce Cub Scouts, Webelos and Brownies to orienteering. These Scouts will participate in small groups of two to four Scouts. Each group of no more than four Scouts must be accompanied by an adult, who should follow his/her group, not lead it. \r\n\r\nCourse 2 \r\n\r\nCourse 2 is for pairs of Tenderfoot, Second Class and First Class Boy Scouts, and Girl Scout Juniors. It is recommended that an adult trail the pair, but NOT communicate with the Scouts except in the case of an emergency.\r\n\r\nCourse 3 \r\n\r\nCourse 3 is for pairs of Star, Life and Eagle Boy Scouts, and Girl Scout Cadettes and Seniors. No adults are allowed to accompany teams on this course.\r\n\r\nCourse 4 \r\n\r\nCourse 4 is for individual entrants only-no pairs. It is limited to Scouts (including Explorers and Adult Scouters) with a fair amount of orienteering experience.\r\nRemember, only Courses 2 and 3 count toward the team and troop competitive award scoring. Course 4 counts for the individual award competition. \r\n\r\nHow long will it take?\r\n\r\nThat really depends on the kids. Some race through their courses in less than 1 hour, others take their time and stay out 2 to 2(1/2) hours. This is true of all the courses. \r\n\r\nWhat are the merit badge requirements that can be completed through this event?\r\n\r\nScouts should be able to pass off requirement 1a for 2nd Class (explain map and compass - the course is not long enought to pass off 1b, but you could probably make it so if you go back and forth along the course enough times), and requirement 2 for 1st Class (including the height measurement, although it is not really part of a standard orienteering course). \r\n \r\nBoys can also pass off requirements 2, 3a, 4, 6 and 7a for the merit badge.  If the scouts intend to pass off these requirements, it will work best if they come ready to show/explain/identify; there are so many groups coming through there isn''t enough time to properly explain everything and then test each scout.  It will also help give them a better experience if they have already reviewed the merit badge workbook before coming (http://meritbadge.org/wiki/images/1/13/Orienteering.pdf).\r\n \r\n\r\nFor more information, call or e-mail Ellen Boomer at 509-240-7633 begin_of_the_skype_highlightingÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 509-240-7633Â Â Â Â Â Â end_of_the_skype_highlighting (evenings and weekends) or boomerellen@yahoo.com \r\n\r\nSponsor: Columbia River Orienteering Club, a nonprofit organization whose mission is to promote the sport of orienteering in the Northwest.\r\n\r\nCost = $7.50 per team.  \r\nLate entries (entry fee paid day of event) = $10.00 per team.\r\n\r\n<b>Pre-registration:</b>\r\n\r\n<b>All Scout-O participants must be pre-registered by April 3, 2010.</b> This year you can register online or through regular mail.\r\n\r\nRegistration contact: Ellen Boomer\r\n\r\n<b>Online registration:</b>\r\n\r\nPlease read the information below, and then <a href="http://www.croc.org/scouto/scouto_start.php">click here to go to online registration.</a> \r\n\r\n1.)
